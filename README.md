### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Maksim!

Description of me and my works:
I am a PHP backend developer. Decided to become a programmer about 9 moths ago, for that time learned a lot of new and usefull things. But still I am always learning something new in each day. Want to become really good developer, to help people Ð¸ring ideas to life. Biggest time of my programmers life worked with vanila PHP and Laravel framework, also got works completed with react and NextJS frameworks.
